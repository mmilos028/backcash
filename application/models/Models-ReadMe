Backoffice uses Zend framework model classes to comunicate with
Oracle database.
In Model classes are stored procedure calls to oracle database.
First method in class is __construct which is php constructor and it reads
for configuration to create database connection through dbAdapter class.
Every procedure returns ref cursors as results from database and they are converted to php arrays.
