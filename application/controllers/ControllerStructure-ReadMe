Controller classes are bussines logic for backoffice system.
Each class containes init() method which helps that backoffice has 
the same template rules for all pages, it also initialiazes some variables used in controller class.
Usualy pagination information is setted here if it does not exist in session memory.

When user calls for any page in backoffice preDispatch() method is called each time before loading the page.
When user logs into backoffice his informations are stored in applications session space.
In this method is checked if user is authenticated every time before calling some page.
Also when user enters backoffice successfully this is stored in database and therefore is 
checked if users session is active and regular in database from backoffice system.
If users session is not regular in application and database space then user is logged out.

Each method from class Controllers contains reserved word Action in its ending, for example
MethodAction() calls for page method and shows in browser view page
 which is found in application/views/scripts/CONTROLLES_CLASS_NAME/method.phtml location. 
 
Some classes contain private members such as:
- session_id is session number given by opening user session from database
- session_space contains informations from user during his entering into backoffice
- defaultPerPage is number of items per page usually is 25 or given by user when generating report from limit field
